Ng-spice-rework-12
============
Arno did a great work this summer!
The pole-zero analysis has been corrected. The error was introduced 
in an attempt to eliminate compiler warnings. The source has been 
reworked and info file have been updated. As you may see, a new dir 
called "spicelib" has been created, another step toward the separation
of the simulator from the frontend. 

Ng-spice-rework-11
============

Resistor code (device) has been modified to conform to spice3 device 
coding standard. 
A new step function (U2) has been introduced.
Documentation updated.

Ng-spice-rework-10
============

Added BSIM4 model and closed a couple of serious bugs. Added DEVICES
file to distribution. This file contains the status of device models
in this simulator. Read it, this file can save you a lot of time.

Ng-spice-rework-9
============

Thanks to Arno Peters now all device models are dynamically loaed on
demand.  Thay are linked as shared libraries. The next step is the
dlopen() one which will make possible to link devices without any
recompilation.



Ng-spice-rework-8
============

Applied Arno's patch.

From his mail message:

Hi Paolo,

I have prepared a source cleaning patch.

Features:

  + patches don't get polluted with differences between automatically
  generated Makefile.am files.  Usually these make up the biggest part
  of the patches.  This allows me to read the patch on the mailing
  list instead of sifting through 90% redundant and irrelevant changes.

  + the shell script autogen.sh automatically regenerates the required
  files if the user has automake, autoconf and libtool installed.

  + this feature is only valuable to developers, not to end users.


Usage of this patch, once incorporated:

  # create a working tree to work from
  cp -a ng-spice-rework-x ng-spice
  
  [ Changes made to ng-spice ]

  # clean up all the automatically generated files
  cd ng-spice; make maintainer-clean

  # extract the differences
  diff -ruN ng-spice-rework-x ng-spice > my.patch

  [ Patch sent to ng-spice mailing list or you ]

  # incorporate changes into the tree
  cd ng-spice-rework-x; patch -p1 < my.patch

  # update the automatically generated files
  cd ng-spice-rework-x; sh autogen.sh




Ng-spice-rework-7 (22 Mar 2000)
============

Bug fix release



Ng-spice-rework-6 (29 Jan 2000)
============

This porting includes:

1) BSIM3V3.1 model as level 49. This is the version modified by Serban
Popescu which understands the M parameter and implements HDIF.

2) BSIM3V3.2 model al Level 50. This is the standard Berkeley version.

3) Now the resistor model can accepts two differents values for DC and
AC resistance.



Ng-spice-rework-5 and 5_2  (Jan 2000)
============

Internal development release, buggy and not working. 

Ng-spice-rework-4  (22/12/99)
============

This porting includes a new feature:

1) dynamically loading of some device code as an experimental feature
for the future GPL simulator. Thanks to Arno Peters and Manu Rouat.

2) Patched the following bug (thanks to Andrew Tuckey for having
supplied the patch).
   
    * Wsw (current controlled switch) in subckt, parsing bug.
    * scale factor in arbitrary source.
    * bug in noise analisys.
    * save segmentation faults.
