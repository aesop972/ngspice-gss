ANALYSES
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This file lists the analyses currently implemented into ngspice.

AC    : Small-signal frequency response analysis

DC    : DC-sweep analysis
        + Added resistance sweep as in spice 2.
        * Note: It is possible to perform a generic parametric sweep ?

DISTO : Small signal distortion analysis

NOISE : Noise analysis

OP    : Operating point analysis

PZ    : Pole-Zero analysis

SENS  : Sensitivity analysis

TF    : Transfer function analysis

TRAN  : Transient analysis
