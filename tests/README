ngspice test and example files:
===============================

This directory is organized as a tree of subdirectories containing test and
example files for the models and analyses implemented in ngspice.
Some files comes from the original Spice3f5 and Cider1b1 distributions
or have been contributed by developers and users and others come directly 
from the models developers.  


File Extensione Convention:

.cir : Circuit file. This can be a simple circuit description or a spice2
       input file.
.sp  : Spice file. This is a circuit file with a ".control" section; 
       "sp" files are batch scripts describing the circuit and the 
       operations to do on it.
.out : Some .cir files have been run and results are recorded into this
       type of file. This is useful if want to test ngspice against
       known (hopefully correct results).
