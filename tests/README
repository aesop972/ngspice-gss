ngspice test files:
===================

The test directory contains several netlist designed to test ngspice functionality and correctness.
There are netlists that test devices behavior and netlists that test analyses correctness.

REPLICATE TESTS

Tests are done with an ngspice compiled with the following options:

  --enable-ftedebug     <- Should have no effect
  --enable-nobypass   
  --enavle-predictor
  --enable-experimental <- Living on the edge :)

TO ADD NEW TESTS

Take an existing test and adopt it to your liking.  Add the test
script and its supporting files to Makefile.am.  Use `make check' to
see your new test in action.
