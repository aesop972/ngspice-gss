 * src/frontend/inp.c: corrected option processing. Now "scale" option 
   is special and is processed before netlist parsing. The implementation
   is not very clean. 

2007-11-04 Dietmar Warning
 * configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/spicelib/devices/Makefile.am, 
   src/spicelib/parser/inpgmod.c, src/spicelib/parser/inp2m.c
   BSIM4 has changed (based on Phil Barker patch):
   version code 4.2.1/4.3.0/4.5.0 added
   4.4.0 small corrections
   4.6.0 updated to 4.6.1

2007-10-12 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
 * src/frontend/{cpitf.c, inp.c, miscvars.c}, src/spinit.in: 
   reimplemented "brief" option as a boolean and defaulted to
   TRUE. Now the netlist is not printed anymore when you load 
   a circuit. For the original behavior uncomment "unset brief"
   in the spice init file.

2007-10-11 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
 * src/main.c, src/frontend/{inpcom.c, miscvars.c}: added option -a
   and --autorun to add the control section ans run the loaded netlist.
   In the original implementation by Phil Barker, the loaded circuit was
   always run, both in interactive and batch mode.

2007-10-09 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
 * src/frontend/{device.c, miscvars.c}: added "altshow" option to 
   enable the new (Phil Barker) version of the show command. The 
   old show command looks better in interactive mode while the
   new format is more suitable for automatic processing of the
   data.
 * src/maths/ni/niiter.c: added check on iteration numbers (Phil Barker).

2007-10-09 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
 * src/frontend/cktdojob.c: Chenged of reporting analysis temperature
   from Kelvins to Celsius (as suggested from Phil Barker).
 * src/spicelib/parser/inp2m.c: Added model binning code left out in the
   previous commit.
 * src/frontend/variable.c: Added SIMVARS from Phil Barker.
 * src/frontend/{outitf.c,runcoms2.c}, src/include/cpextern.h: Patch from 
   Phil Barker.
 * src/frontend/subckt.c: allow for .ic, .nodeset names to be embedded 
   in a subckt;enhanced subckt.c to created appropriate node names for 
   flattened simulation netlist (Phil Barker).
 * src/spicelib/devices/cap/cap.c: aliased capacitance parameter with "c"
   and "cap" (patch from Phil Barker).
 * src/spicelib/devices/res/res.c: aliased some parameters. Originally got
  the patch from Phil Barker but used IOPR (redundant) instead of IOPZ.
 * src/spicelib/devices/res/resparam.c: Added fix for zero valued 
   resistors (Phil Barker).
 * src/spicelib/devices/vsrc/{vsrc.c, vsrcacct.c, vsrcask.c, vsrcdefs.h,
   vsrcload.c, vsrcpar.c, vsrctemp.c}: Added "repeat" parameter to the 
   PWL model.
 * src/xspice/icm/analog/multi_input_pwl/*: added new element from Phil
   Barker: added new multi-input gate VCVS using XSPICE extensions that 
   supports nand, and, nor, or.  Currently only supports 2-inputs (x,y).
   The x's and y's represent the piecewise linear variation of output as 
   a function of input.  Only 1 input determines the state of the outputs: 
   and/nand: controlling input is chosen on the basis of the smallest value,
   or/nor:   controlling input is chosen on the basis of the largest value.

   of a device

2007-10-08 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
 * src/frontend/{inp.c, inpcom.c, inpcom.h, measure.c, nutimp.c, runcoms.c
 subckt.c, ftedefs.c, fteext.c, dctran.c, inp2dot.c, inppas2.c}: added
 several improvements mad by Phil Barker:
 - .measure statements: trig/targ, max, min, avg, rms, integral, param
 - autostop option: which causes the simulation to stop if all .measure
   statements are satisfied; option is ignored if any max, min, avg, rms 
   or integ measurements defined. 
 - fixed some floating point number comparisons where the code was checking for
   equality with '==' by adding a routine called 'AlmostEqualUlps'.
 - parametrized subcircuits
 - added support for ".lib" syntax
 - added ability to recursively call spice netlist parser; this allows for 
   reading in additional .include and .lib files defined in other netlist files
 - changed the flattened netlist names created in 'subckt.c' to match other
   spice simulators

2007-10-08 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

 * src/frontend/numparam/{general.h, mystring.c, numpaif.h, numparam.h, 
   nupatest.c, spicenum.c, washprog.c, xpressn.c}: Applied patch from Phil 
 Barker that improves the capabilites of numparam library. Now numparam 
 supports fully parametrized netlists and can handle a larger set of 
 parameters than the previous implementation. Added 'nupa_add_param' routine 
 and ability to reevaluate parameter set using 'nupa_eval' by keeping parameter
 value set. Added support for 'ternary' operators in parameters as well as 'max'
 and 'min'.

2007-09-17 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
 * src/frontend/com_let.c: Applied patch from Friedrich Schmidt to fix
 the big in let command that prevented the following command to be
 correctly interpreted: let vec=vector(10)  let vec[2]=5.0 and returning
 an error instead. The patch has been submitted by Friedrich Schmidt.

2007-09-14 Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
 * src/frontend/inp.c: fixed a bug in com_list() that skipped a line number 
 when in displaying the ".end" line. I just moved the line increment at the 
 end of the for cicle (after the instruction that skips the ".end" line).


2007-09-12 Dietmar Warning

     introduced into this file around line 4015 - 4020 are wrong. Back to
     original Berkeley's code.

2005-12-02  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

 *  src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_ph.c: added a missing include 
    (patch by Paul Reich).

 *  src/frontend/numparam/general.h, src/maths/ni/niiter.c, 
    src/spicelib/devices/csw/{cswload.c, cswmpar.c}, 
    src/spicelib/devices/hfet1/{hfetload.c, hfetsetup.c},
    src/spicelib/devices/hfet2/{hfet2load.c, hfet2setup.c},
    src/spicelib/devices/hisim/hisim.h, src/spicelib/parser/ptfuncs.c: 
    partially applied Paul Reich patch that removed C++ style comments.


2005-11-27  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

    by John Murdie.


2005-11-13  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
 
 *  src/spicelib/devices/bsim4/*: Updated bsim4 to version 4.5.0 using the
    code hacked by Hitoshi Tanaka and Dietmar Warning. Changes from original
    Berkeley's device group implementation:
    - Added multiplier parameter (m parameter).
    - Added NodeSet for internal nodes.
    - Removed #ifdef STDC and non STDC function prototypes
    - Added missing "pParam->BSIM4ku0we" to fprintf in b4temp.c.    
 
 *  src/spicelib/devices/bsim4/b4temp.c: fixed the following bug (Dietmar
    Warning):
    
    - Freed old node adding FREE(model->pSizeDependParamKnot); near line 146.
     
 *  src/spicelib/devices/bsim4/b4set.c: fixed the following bug (Dietmar 
    Warning):
    
    - Removed double testing for model->BSIM4prtGiven.  
 
 *  src/spicelib/devices/bsim4/b4ld.c: fixed the following bugs:
 
    - In the computation of ggts and ggtd near line 4014 here->BSIM4gcrgd
      and here->BSIM4gcrgs were exchanged. (Dietmar Warning).
    
    - In the computation of gcqdb and gcqsb near line 4019 here->BSIM4cqsb
      and here->BSIM4cqdb were exchanged (Hitoshi Tanaka).  
    

2005-11-07  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

 *  src/spicelib/devices/vbic/*: Dietmar Warning sent a patch to his last
    vbic implementation:
     - Added temperature dependence for RB and RC, 
     - fixed a bug in current sign (reversing vbei and vbci),
     - removed double allocation of substrate node.
        

2005-10-19  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

 * src/Makefile.am: Implemented fix to prevent 'multiple definition' errors 
   during link of nghelp when built on systems that use the latest versions of
   the GNU tools. Solution provided by Andreas Unger <a_unger@gmx.de>. 

2005-10-15  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  * src/frontend/spiceif.c: Fixed code to avoid errors (invalid lvalue in 
    assignment) under gcc v4.0.2 or and warnings under gcc 4.0.0 (target of 
    assignment not really an lvalue).

2005-10-15  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  * INTALL: Improved notes for MinGW/MSYS

  * src/frontend/resource.c: Fixed problems of reporting resource usage for
    MacOSX (should help other platforms too).

  * src/frontend/terminal.c: Fixed warning about unused variables and functions
    that can occur when HAVE_TERMCAP is undefined.

  * src/spicelib/devices/isrc/isrcload.c and vsrcload.c: Implemented patches
    supplied by Andreas Unger <a_unger@gmx.de>. Fixes XSpice bug; variable PER 
    was being used before initialisation.

2005-09-19  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  * xgraph/idraw.c, xgraph/tgif.c and xgraph/xtb.c: Added missing system header
    includes (string.h and stdio.h) to avoid warnings.

  * src/frontend/aspice.c: Used (void*)0 instead of 0  for the terminating
    vararg, to avoid gcc 4.0 warning about  missing  sentinel in function call.

  * src/frontend/aspice.c: Resolved Bug 1293746 - Problem with aspice.c(171)
    in gcc (Solaris).

  * src/frontend/display.c: Fixed warning about redefinition of XtNumber.

2005-09-09  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Reverted to placing the cp_* stream variable definitions back in to
     src/frontend/streams.c with their extern declarations in
     src/frontend/streams.h

2005-09-08  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  * Added hard-coded paths for NGSPICEBINDIR and NGSPICEDATADIR for MinGW
    targets (src/conf.h)


2005-09-08  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *  src/frontend/streams.{c,h}: applied Hitoshi's fix for undefined 
     symbols when compiling ngspice under Linux.


2005-09-06  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  * Fixed alphabetic order in AUTHORS

  * Adjusted autogen.sh to give more relevant advice when a required
    program is missing.

  * Added ngspice.idx to MAINTAINERCLEANFILES in src/Makefile.am

  * Added work-round for missing scroll bar in help windows for an X11
    display (seems to be an X-Windows bug) src/frontend/x11disp.c

  * Fixed memory leak in tilde expansion - src/frontend/parser/glob.c

  * Fixed spelling errors in tests/README

  * Implemented fix as described by Hitoshi Tanaka for the problem
    that causes "Warning - approaching max data size...." to be
    erroneously reported when compiled with MinGW/MSYS
    src/frontend/resource.c


2005-09-04  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *  src/spicelib/devices/ltra/{ltraload.c, ltraacld.c, ltratrun.c}:    
     Applied Hitoshi's patches to fix ltra code. The bug produced a 
     "Timestep too small" in simulations and uninitialized variables 
     produced wrong results in some files under MinGW.
     
  *  src/spicelib/parser/inp2d.c:     
     Fixed a bug that causes an "unknown parameter(save)" error if there 
     is the expression like the following in the netlist of Cider analysis.

     D1  1 2 M_PN AREA=100 save
     (Fix from Hitoshi Tanaka).

  *  src/frontend/streams.c:
     Fix to a bug that caused crash when I input "listing" command after 
     loading Cider examples under Ngspice compiled by Visual C++. 
     (Fix from Hitoshi Tanaka).
          
      

2005-08-30  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  ============================ Rework-17 ==================================
  
  *  src/frontend/numparam/Makefile.am: added missing include that prevented
     its dist-ribution.

2005-08-29  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  ============================ Rework-16 ==================================


2005-08-26  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org> 

  *  src/fronted/dotcards.c: expressions were not parsed correctly, the bug
     was in the offset from string base: corrected.
     
2005-08-23  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *  src/xspice/icm/xtradev/aswitch/cfunc.mod: Added minimum on resistance
     for aswitch to avoid unreasonable high values (due to near zero 
     resistance) in current of connected voltage source. Change supplied by
     Hitoshi Tanaka.
     
  *  src/xspice/icm/{cfunc.mod}: updated cfunc.mod files. Changes sent by
     Hitoshi Tanaka.   

2005-08-22  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *  src/frontend/plotting/x11.c: removed casting in a macro. It conflicts
     with the strictier syntax of recent gcc compilers. 

2005-08-15  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Yet more changes to the doc build system - see doc/ChangeLog for details

  *  In INSTALL added --enable-maintainer-mode as an argument to ./configure
     when building straight from CVS.  This is now necessary due to the use of
     version.texi to allow versioning info to be passed into the documentation
     system.

2005-08-14  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  More changes to the documentation. Specifically the make dist now produces
     a PDF file.  See doc/ChangeLog for details

  *  Update the AUTHORS file and adjusted formatting to make it more compatable
     with the texinfo include

2005-08-11  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Fixed problem with text2dvi and makeinfo when running make dist

  *  Corrected many spelling errors in doc/ngspice.texi

2005-08-08  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
  
  *    src/frontend/dotcards.c: Applied patch from Mike Waters 
       <M.Waters@bom.gov.au> to parse probes in the form:
       vm(4,0) or vm(0,4). Where one of the nodes is ground ie. 0, if 
       the probe is "v" everything works but anything else ie. "vm", "vp", 
       etc. fails.

2005-08-06  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/xspice/mif/mifsetup.c: Updated MIFunsetup to the latest version
      provided by Hitoshi Tanaka.


2005-08-04  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   Fixed a bug in memory management of xspice/ngspice that caused
      segmentation fault for codemodels that adds their own states to
      the state vector. Changes supplied by Hitoshi Tanaka 
      (HDA01055@nifty.com):

      * src/math/ni/niiter.c: removed the first malloc for OldCKTstate0
        since the number of states can be altered by xspice code models.
        This was already addressed in the past but this line remained.

      * src/xspice/mif/mifsetup.c: added MIFunsetup() to conform to spice3f
        devices model interface (xspice was based on spice3c1).

      * src/xspice/xspice.c, src/xspice/cm/cmexport.c,
        src/xspice/cmpp/writ_ifs.c: changed the entry corresponding to the
        unsetup function from NULL to MIFunsetup.

      * src/include/mifproto.h: added prototype for MIFunsetup.
      
      * src/spicelib/analysis/cktsetup.c: cleared node if initial condition
        of nodeset are given to fix a segfaults on second run of xspice
        netlists.


2005-06-30  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/resource.c: added IPC stuff
  
  *   src/spicelib/parser/inpptree.c: fixed bug in power function.

2005-06-25  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *  src/spicelib/analysis/acan.c: modified original integration of xspice 
     event driven algorithm into spice3 code. Now CKTncDump() is used by
     xspice too. 

  *  src/spicelib/analysis/cktdojob.c: added ipc stuff.

  *  src/spicelib/analysis/cktload.c: cosmetics.

  *  src/spicelib/analysis/cktop.c: modularized the source and gmin stepping 
     algorithm. I have extracted the code for gmin and source stepping to
     improve CKTop readability and maintainability. 
     
  *  src/spicelib/analysis/dcop.c: added event driven algorithm and ipc stuff.

  *  src/spicelib/analysis/dctran.c: added xspice breakpoint control.

  *  src/spicelib/analysis/dctrcurv.c: added event driven algorithm and ipc 
     stuff.



2005-06-12  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Changes supplied bt Hitoshi Tanaka to allow XSpice to compile using MinGW
     in Windows. Main change points are as follows:
       (1) dlopen(), dlsym(), dlclose() and dlerror() were changed
           to the functions of Windows. (src/spicelib/dev.c)
       (2) The functions relation to IPC were removed. (src/xspice/ipc/ipc.c,
           and src/xspice/ipc/ipcsockets.c)

2005-06-09  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Fixed *# command operation (src/frontend/inp.c)
  
  *  Added 'hack' to allow the 'numparams' variable to be set (or unset) before
     the netlist part of a file is parsed. This is based on code supplied by
     Dietmar Warning, with  changes to allow it to work with the *# syntax, the
     unset keyword and variable amounts of white space. (src/frontend/inp.c)
     
  *  line_free(line,flag) is now a macro so that line is set to NULL when it is
     freed. (src/frontend/inp.c) This is a safty mechnism.

2005-05-31  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Applied fix for logging supplied by Dietmar Warning (src/main.c)
  
  *  Miscellaneous tidying in src.main.c for format, indentation, #include
     style ("" vis-a-vis <>)  and removal of some compile time warnings.

2005-05-30  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>
  
  *  Corrected return types (where necessary) for the functions that make up the
     devices[] array initialised in src/frontend/display.c, and used specific
     #includes rather than extern references. Added new headers as required.
     
  *  Moved jbuf from src/main.c to src/frontend/signal_handler.c 
  
  *  Tidy up of the header files in src/frontend and sub-directories. Motivation
     is to remove extern declarations within .c files and place in .h files. New
     header files where necessary.

2005-05-28  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Fix bug introduced in my last change. Fix supplied by Hitoshi Tanaka.
     Bug can cause a segmentation fault.
     
  *  Fixed the format of section 5.3.37. Save* in src/ngsoice.txt
  
  *  In src/frontend/plotting replaced extern references in .c files wiith
     #include of suitable header files.
    
  *  Added src/frontend/numparam/numpaif.h for the external interface to the
     numparam library.

2005-05-26  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Fixed bug with define (see bug reference [ 999546 ] 'define' is broken 
     in ngspice-15).
     
  *  Fixed bug with 'plot title title_name' (see bug [ 557638 ] plot 
     segmentation fault).

2005-05-23  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Fixed a divide-by-zero bug in the MOS level=2 device model
     the fix was supplied by Hitoshi Tanaka.
     
  *  Fixed a 'core-dump' that could be caused by the interactive 'write' command
     when the plot contains more than one dimension. This was due to improper
     use of a buffer in rawfile.c as pointed out by Dietmar Warning. Bug also
     affected ngsconvert.

2005-05-22  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  src/frontend/numparam/mystring.c - fix for MinGW from Hitoshi Tanaka.

  *  various files - removal of more warning due to unused variables

2005-05-21  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  src/spicelib/devices/vbic/vbicinit.c Fixed a structure initialisation
     problem that occurs when cider is enabled. Also fixes lots of warning
     within ciderlib related to unused variables.

  *  Fixed a compile warning in src/frontend/com_history.c when readline
     or editline are used.

  *  Removed the files src/misc/terminal.h/.c and src/include/terminal.h
     The first two were empty and the last just included the second.
     The relevant makefile.am files have been updated, so a ./configure
     will need to be re-run before building.

  *  Fixed problems where printf format was int yet on some systems the argument
     is long (due to size_t being long). Fixed by always using long format and
     casting to long. Affected src/frontend/spiceif.c and src/misc/alloc.c
     This makes obsolete the IS_SIZE_T_LONG macro that defined by configure.in,
     now removed -it was not working for all platforms (eg. MacOSX)

  *  configure.in - Removed IS_SIZE_T_LONG (see above). Now only test for
     ncurses etc., when either Readline or Editline are being used.  This will
     fix the basic problem of building on MinGW which does not have these
     libraries as standard.  Fixed the typo in the AC_REVISION() macro.

2005-05-20  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  nghelp now uses src/conf.c for consistency with ngspice and ngnutmeg.
     Under MinGW the nghelp window is now kept open until a key is pressed.
     This allows users to see any error messages before the system closes
     the window.

  *  src/conf.c now uses PACKAGE_VERSION (was VERSION) and PACKAGE_BUGREPORT
     (was hard coded in file to "ngspice-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net"). These
     values are set by the AC_INIT macro in configure.in

  *  src/winmain.c - changes to fix warning when compiled with gcc

2005-05-19  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Fixed declaration of oflag in winmain.c - fix from Dietmar Warning

  *  Fixed compile of makeidx for MinGW.

2005-05-18  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Reverted src/spicelib/devices/restemp.c to previous version. Changes in
     this file were intended for temporary debug and should not have been
     committed to CVS.

  *  Moved isnan() to src/misc/missing_math.c from src/spicelib/devices/dev.c
     following suggestion from Dietmar Warning. Also took opportunity to fixed
     a compiler warning in dev.c

  *  Conversion of files containing non-ASCII characters (German language
     comments) to ASCII by Dietmar Warning.


2005-05-18  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  I erroneously omitted a few changes from Dietmar Warning:
     Fix to src/maths/cmaths/Makefile.am to exclude test programs that don't
     compile under MinGW. Fix to src/spicelib/devices/dev.c to exclude local
     isnan() when it exists as a library function.
     
  *  Fixes to src/Makefile.am to exclude programs that don't compile under
     Windows (MinGW). Fix to avoid dependence problem with linking in winmain.o

2005-05-17  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Updates configure.in. Notably this removes the need for acconfig.h (the use
     of which is deprecated by autoconf). Most of the remaining changes just
     tidy with the aim of following guidelines in the autoconf manual. Fixed an
     issue with CFLAGS usage and --disable-debug. Some fixes aimed as support
     for MinGW (more to follow).
     
  *  Removed acconfig.h (see above for reason).

  *  Updated various file to allow build using MinGW. Affected files: src/main.c,
     src/nghelp.c, src/frontend/evaluate.c, src/frontend/resource.c,
     src/frontend/signal_handler.c, src/frontend/wdisp/windisp.c,
     src/frontend/wdisp/winprint.c, src/include/macros.h
     These changes mostly supplied by Dietmar Warning.
     Highlights: macros used for sigjmp_buf (JMP_BUF), sigsetjmp (SETJMP) and
     siglongjmp (LONGJMP); Fixed problem of duplicated definition of BOOL.
     Adjustments to allow ngnutmeg to compile with a Windows frontend.

2005-05-11  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Changed line-ending on several files from DOS to UNIX.
  
  *  Translated German in to English in comments for several files
     (where the German was simple and meaning clear from the context
      - and Babel fish helped too). This also removes the non-ASCII
      characters from these files, which was giving problems on
      at least one platform.
      
  *  In the above files I have also replaced c++ comment style with
     c comments (i.e. // go to /* ... */).

2005-05-10  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Some minor tidy-up as follows:
      - Added missing .cvsignore files in many source directories.
      - Added #ifdef CIDER...#endif around fields in structure initialisation
        of nbjt, nbjt2, numd, numd2 and numos - this is strictly unnecessary
        as these devices are only used when CIDER is defined but it keeps
        symmetry with other devices.
      - Added some extra TRACE debug statments in in the parser
  
  *  Added conditional on the ngspice program to prevent errors when spiceinit
     file is used with ngnutmeg (spiceinit.in)

2005-05-10  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *  src/spicelib/devices/isrc/*,src/spicelib/devices/vsrc/*: added
     XSPICE extensions: PHASE parameter and current in isrc. Added AM
     transient function (Amplitude Modulation):
     
        AM (sig_ampl offset_const mod_freq carrier_freq t_delay)
     
        The waveform will follow:
     
        value = sig_ampl*{offset_const + SIN(2*PI*mod_freq*(t-t_delay))}*
                SIN(2*PI*carrier_freq*(t-t_delay))
       
        As an example you can use:
      
              V1 1 0 AM(10 1 1K 100 1M) 

              R1 1 0 1
      
2005-05-09  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Added new syntax to the the resistor card to support HSpice style
     temperature dependence (from Hitoshi Tanaka <HDA01055@nifty.com>).
     Syntax forms now include:
       Rxxx <n1> n2> <val> TC=<val1>
       Rxxx <n1> n2> <val> TC1=<val1>
       Rxxx <n1> n2> <val> TC1=<val1> TC2=<val2>
       Rxxx <n1> n2> <val> TC=<val1> <val2>
     The the first pair are equivalent, and the last pair are equivalent.     

2005-05-07  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Added support for the BSD licensed editline library
     This includes a work-around to fix a problem found in the current version
     of this library (see prompt() in src/main.c).
     
  *  Added and updated infomation in the INSTALL file.

2005-05-06  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Added code by by H.Tanaka for the .global keyword. This is enabled by
     supplying the new --enable-dot-global argument to ./configure.
     
  *  Also added configuration for a new --with-editline=yes|no argument to
     ./configure for future support of the BSD editline library as an
     alternative to the GNU readline library.

2005-05-05  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *  Fixed a compile problem with Xspice on Cygwin. Still will not link, but
     it's a step in the right direction.

2005-05-04  Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>

  *   Fixed issues with the alternate prompt (src/main.c, src/frontent/control.c
      and src/include/cpextern.h) - a format problem when used with readline and
      a buffer overrun. Also reduced max number of chevrons to 16 and added + at
      start when command stack is holding than 16.
  
  *   Translations for German comments provided by Dietmar Warning, to fix
      issue with UTF-8 observed on Windows (src/main.c)
      
  *   Fixed readline operation within ngnutmeg (src/main.c). Also include some
      minor tidy-up to avoid some compiler warnings. Updated copyright date
      for --help.

2005-04-29  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/inpcom.c: end-of-line comments starting with
      the "$" (dollar) sign can be confused with a variable. To 
      avoid this, the new syntax for such and-of-line comment is:
        $ <any comment> (the space is mandatory). 
      Patch sent from Steven Borley <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk>.
      

2005-04-26  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/main.c, src/frontend{inp.c, nutinp.c}, src/include/defines.h:
      New logic for ngspice initialization (patch from Steven Borley 
      <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk>):
      
              Load the standard start up file 'spinit'
              Then look for '.spiceinit' in current directory
              If this fails look for 'spice.rc' in currect directory
              if this fails the check the HOME environment variable
              if HOME is set then:
                Look for for '.spiceinit' in user's home directory
                If this fails look for 'spice.rc' in user's home directory.
       
       Fixed a memory leak in main.c   
  
  *  src/include/{complex.h, fteext.h, ngspice.h, sperror.h}:
     code cleaning and removed some warning (patch from Steven Borley).
    
2005-04-25  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/numparam/{general.h, numparam.h, nupatest.c, 
      spicenum.c, washprog.c, xpressn.c}: Applied patch from Steven
      Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>. The patch removed the numparam
      support for end-of-line comments and moved it into frontend code.
      Line buffer for numparam is increased from 250 to 1000 to accomodate
      large model cards. Fixed compilation on Cygwin and MacOSX.
  
  *   src/frontend/subckt.c: numparams, once compiled in, must be 
      enabled, during interactive session, using "set numparams". Since
      library is experimental and under continuos testing, it is not
      yet intended for general use and support is provided for interactive
      sessions only (patch from Steven Borley). 
      
  *   src/frontend/{device.c, spiceif.c}: fixed case sensitivity problems 
      in key-word identification (patch from Steven Borley).
  
  *   src/frontend/inp.c: Fix a bug where the wrong argument to 'listing'
      would error, but still produce a listing (patch from Steven Borley).
      
  *   src/frontend/inpcom.c: From Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net>
      patch:
        End-of-line comments have been fixed and can be used on a line 
        that is followed by a continuation line.  This functionality 
        has been moved from the numparams library and in to the front 
        end code. All the following can be used to start a comment:
               ;       for compatibility with PSpice
               $       for compatibility with HSpice
               //      like C++, and as per numparams
               --      as per numparams
              This was a full re-write of this code, not a conversion of the
        numparams code. It is not dependent on the numparams library.
  
  *   src/frontend/resource.c:  Fixed a compile bug under window & cygwin
      (patch from Steven Borley).
      
  *   src/frontend/plotting/x11.c: Applied patch from Steven Borley. 
  
  *   src/spicelib/analysis/cktsetbk.c: Added some code to track
      breakpoints (you need to define TRACE_BREAKPOINT macro).
            

2005-04-16  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/{subckt.c, inpcom.c}, src/frontend/numparam/{general.h,
       mystring.c, readme.txt, spicenum.c, xpressn.c}: Applied patch from
       Steven Borley <steven.borley@virgin.net> that fixed numparam
       library. Patch description follow (extracted from Steven's 
       message):
       
       > Fixes problem with logfile not being opened before we have 
         something to write to it,
             > Renamed round() and trunc() to avoid clash with functions in 
         math.h,
             > Numparam now only stops execution when it finds errors,
             > Added some debug tracing (normally off),
             > Added some debug tracing (normally off),
             > Fixes a #ifdef that had a typo and thus stopped numparams,
         working,
             > Renames a local variable to avoid confusion (of the 
               developer/maintainer),
             > Fixes the renumbering of lines from a .include file.
       
  *    examples/numparam/{example.cir, pintest.cir,pin.mod}: added
       netlists sent with Steven's patch.
  

  *   src/frontend/subckt.c: Added fix sent by Hitoshi Tanaka 
      <HDA01055@nifty.com>. Now nodes starting with the letter "v"
      in subcircuits are translated correctly (as internal nodes)
      and not as voltage sources v<NIL>.
      
  *   src/xspice/cmpp/pp_lst.c: malloc did not consider the null
      terminating character in "path". Applied patch from Mac OSX
      patch file maintained by Khairulmizam Samsudin <kmbs2002@yahoo.com>.
      
  *   src/xspice/icm/makedefs.in: Mac OSX requires different flags 
      for shared libraries linking. Applied patch from Mac OSX patch 
      file maintained by Khairulmizam Samsudin <kmbs2002@yahoo.com>.      

2005-04-06  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/subckt.h: Since inp_numnodes has been declared static
      the prototype has been removed.

2005-04-04  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/subckt.c: Applied patch from Steven Borley
      <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk> that fixes a bug in model
      name translation that shows in nested subckts reported by
      Hitoshi Tanaka <HDA01055@nifty.com> (for which he sent a patch that
      was supersed by Steven's one).
      
  *   configure.in: As Stuart Brorson suggested now the garbage collector
      library is compiled only on explicit request by the user.     

2005-03-20  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/spicelib/analysis/cktntask.c: The default parallel
      multiplier (m=1) for  mosfet levels 1, 2, 3 and 9 was not set 
      in interactive analyses. Applied fix sent by Steven Borley 
      <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk>.
      
  *   Changed value of trtol to 1 when xspice extensions are compiled
      (as in xspice source code).    

2005-03-17  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/main.c: Applied patch sent by Steven Borley
      <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk> that removed the duplicate
      declaration application_name and gnu_history_file, removed the
      "static" keyword in shutdown() and set NULL as return value in
      function prompt() when non prompt is passed to readline().
      
  *   src/ngspice.txt: Applied patch sent by Steven Borley 
      <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk> that fixed a few errors that 
      corrupted text output.
      
  *   configure.in:   Applied patch sent by Steven Borley 
      <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk> that fixes compiler warnings
      on MAC OSX (related to the linking order of X libraries). The 
      remaining changes fix errors in spelling. 
      
  *   tests/bin/check.sh: Applied patch sent by Steven Borley 
      <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk> that added support for Mac OSX
      and a default case for not (yet) supported architectures.
      
  *   src/frontend/aspice.c: Applied patch sent by Steven Borley 
      <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk> that fixed compiler warnings on 
      Mac OSX in definition of "status".
      
  *   src/spicelib/devices/bsim3/b3set.c: Applied patch sent by Steven 
      Borley <steven.borley@diode.demon.co.uk> that remove the compiler
      warnings about ambiguous "else".

2005-03-13  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   tests/bin/check.sh: Changed the previous check script with the one
      supplied by Dietmar warning <warning@danalyse.de>. This new script
      adds support for different architectures (MINGW32, Linux, SunOS). 
  
  *   src/spicelib/device/vbic/vbicpzld.c: Corrected an error in pole-zero
      routine. Dietmar Warning <warning@danalyse.de> sent the fix.
       
2005-03-07  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/spicelib/devices/bsim4/b4ld.c: commented out NEWCONV section.

2005-03-06  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/spicelib/devices/bsim4: removed uninitialized variables in model
      files.
  
  *   src/spicelib/analysis/dctrcurv.c: Dietmar Warning
      <warning@danalyse.de> has changed the way the lst point in a dc
      sweep is computed. This new scheme is more accurate.    
    

2005-02-28  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   DEVICES: Updated (again) changing BSIM4 level from 60 to 14 since
      older model revisions are not yet in ngspice. This is consistent
      with model developers: newer models are compatible with older ones.
      
  *   src/spicelib/devices/bsim4/: updated to revision 4.4.0 with "m"
      parallel multiplier enhancements. Thanks to Mick Tooher
      <micktooher@yahoo.com> and Dietmar Warning <warning@danalyse.de> for
      this update.
  
  *   tests/bsim4/: updated test files for bsim4 4.4.0. The old files have
      been replaced with new ones coming from BSIM4 site.  There are new
      tests: (*_gedl*) and ro_17.cir.         

2005-02-25  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   DEVICES: Dietmar Warning (warning@danalyse.de) provided me an
      updated and corrected version of this file.

2005-02-08  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/subckt.c: modified the file with the one supplied by
      Dietmar Warning's (warning@danalyse.de). This fix the bug that
      caused ngspice to crash with long subckt lines.

2004-09-05  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/spicelib/devices/jfet/jfet.c: model type (njf or pjf) was
      defined as input/output parameter. Now is an input-only parameter,
      as in other models.
      
  *   tests/jfet/jfet_vds-vgs.out: Corrected the output after the change
      in jfet.c. With the old code the number associated to njf or pjf
      (meaningless) changed each run of ngspice and caused the check
      process to fail.
      
  *   src/spicelib/devices/mesa/mesa.c: model type was reported
      incorrectly. Declared parameter vt0 as "redundant", since it has
      the same meaning of vto.
  
  *   tests/mesa/mesa11.out: changed test file output according to
      changes in mesa.c. Now model type ic correct.        
       

2004-09-01  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
  
  *   src/conf.c: Modified bug reports address. Now it points to a
      mailing list dedicated to bug reports.
      

2004-08-29  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/fronted/aspice.c: Added a define for FreeBSD (from 
      FreeBSD ports archive).


2004-08-22  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/xspice/enhtrans.c: Removed code introduced by Stuart Brorson to
      limit parsing of POLY statements to dimension 2. Now functions 
      returns a copy of the error strings that i freed by higher level
      code once processed and write the error on the expanded netlist (as
      comments) instead of expanded lines (this fixes a segmentation fault
      since INPpas1() does not check if the returned line is not null and 
      makes expanded netlist more informative). 

2004-08-20  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
  
  *   src/frontend/{gens.h, gens.c, device.c}: Committed another Vera 
      Albrecht's patch for the "show" command. This closes the bug
      definitively.
      
  *   src/include/{cktdefs.h, dgen.h, ftedebug.h, missing_math.h, 
      ngspice.h, noisedef.h, sensdef.h}, 
      src/spicelib/analysis/{ckt.h, ckti2nod.c}: committed Vera 
      Albrecht patch to remove some compiler warnings. 


2004-08-16  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/{device.c, gens.c}: Committed Vera Albrecht's patch
      to the "show command" I closed on 2004-08-13. Vera's patch is 
      better.


2004-08-15  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   configure.in, src/spinit.in: Added a variable in configure.in
      to decomment codemodels lines in spinit if --enable-xspice is
      issued in the configure phase. It is a hack but works.

2004-08-14  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/main.c: The code for -o option contained an error that
      prevented the correct operation of output redirection. The
      masking #ifdef has been changed to #ifndef. 

2004-08-13  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/device.c: "show" command leaked 28 bytes for each
      group of words since an allocated pointer in line 33 of gens.c
      was never freed. It is not possible to free allocated memory 
      using that pointer since it is used and its value altered. I
      used "listdg" copying original pointer value to it and freeing
      memory using "listdg" instead. There were sone "tfree" that 
      caused problems for incorrect inputs, I have removed them and  
      tested against some bad syntax. Results shows no leaks. 
  
  *   src/spicelibe/devices/{res/resparam.c, cap/capparam.c,
      ind/indparam.c}: Fixed a bug introduced with m and acResistance
      parameters. Since show command works as soon as a circuit is 
      loaded, before any call to DEVsetup or DEVtemp is made, some
      parameters, in this early call showed incorrect results. 
      Simulations are not affected by this bug, but it is annoying.
      Now principal parameters are display correctly.
  
  *   src/spicelib/analysis/cktncdump.c: fixed a typo that prevents
      compilation on some systems.      

2004-08-09  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   Updated and corrected test files in "tests" directory. Added
      "examples" directory.
      
  *   src/spicelib/devices/bsim3/b3set.c: Added Dietmar Warning 
      <warning@danalyse.de> patch to solve a bug that shows up when 
      acm=2 was used. From Dietmar's mail message: 
        if we use the acm=2 option we must set the nrd and nrs 
        defaults to 0.
  
  *   src/spicelib/devices/mos3/mos3temp.c: As suggested by Dietmar 
      Warning <warning@danalyse.de> I removed the >1um limit for the 
      model.    

 
2004-07-08  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   Applied Al Niessner <Al.Niessner@jpl.nasa.gov> negabyte patch
      that removed all compiler warnings. 
      
  *   configure.in, src/xspice/icm/makedefs.in, tests/Makefile.am,
      xgraph/aclocal.m4, xgraph/configure.in, xgraph/configure: updated 
      configuration files for autoconf V2.59 automake V1.8.

2004-07-05  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/resource.c: added __APPLE__ for mac osx support as in
      patch sent by Khairulmizam Samsudin <kmbs@hotmail.com>
  
  *   src/spicelib/parser/inpdomod.c: fixed some typos as in patch
      sent by Khairulmizam Samsudin <kmbs@hotmail.com>
      
2004-06-22  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/spicelib/devices/vbic: Vbic code updated. Thanks to Dietmar 
      Warning (warning@danalyse.de )now we have the four terminal 
      version of the VBIC model. The old three terminal version has 
      been discarded.

2004-06-21  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/subckt.c: patch from Stuart Brorson
      <sdb@cloud9.net>. This patch adresses the following
      problem (as written by Stuart):
      Modified modtranslate and devmodtranslate to fix bug noticed 
      by Liu:  codemodel names called out in the device instantiation 
      line ("A1 1 2 3 4 lim") were not translated correctly if they 
      were invoked inside a .subckt.  Fix involved explicitly adding 
      code to handle "A" device types when translating the line.  
      SDB 6.18.2004.      
      

2004-05-30  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/subckt.c: patch from Dietmar Warning 
      (warning@danalyse.de) to fix memory errors when using very 
      long model card.
      
      src/spicelibe/devices/vbic/vbicsetup.c: patch from Dietmar Warning
      (warning@danalyse.de) to fix vbic behavior.


2004-02-14  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.ord>

  *   Trimmed the autoconf interfaces. Added dummy ".out" files
      into many tests subdirectories and modified many Makefile.amS.

2004-02-05  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/spicelib/analysis/cktntask.c: Bug: not all the values
      of TSKtask structure were copied and got a correct default
      value. The bug showed as an infinite loop in gmin stepping.

2004-02-10  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   src/frontend/inpcom.c: Applied patch from Dietmar Warning 
      to solve the bug discovered by Jelle Haandrikman: wrong 
      subcircuit expansion when leading spaces are present in the
      subcircuit netlist. 

2004-01-28  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  *   configure.in 
      src/xspice/cmpp/Makefile src/xspice/cmpp/Makefile.in:
      Make configure automatically set paths for lex yacc and

    value in the input line. There was a missing call to CKTtemp().

2003-08-24  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  * src/maths/sparse/, src/include/complex.h: Added a function
    needed by CIDER in sparse library and started to isolate as
    much as possible sparse code from spice, reverting some of
    the work did in the previous releases. The idea is to design
    an interface between spice and a generic matrix library.
    In the future the current sparse code will be upgraded to
    version 1.4 (http://sparse.sourceforge.net).
  
    src/frontend/misccoms.c, doc/ngspice.texi: Modified "version"

    src/frontend/parser/glob.c, src/include/ngspice.h:
    
    Added Andrew Veliath patch for readline support. Using
    readline with ngspice IS A VIOLATION OF GPL LICENSE, you
    have been warned. The final decision is up to you. The
    patch has been applied in the perspective of changing
    readline library with libedit. Libedit aims to be a
    replacement of readline and is covered by BSD license.
    Libedit is available at the URL: libedit.sourceforge.net.
    
    Readline code has been extrapolated from a patch available
    on  http://www.btae.mam.gov.tr/~genc/ngspice/.

  * A lot of changes that touched too many files to mention each one. 
  I have introduced the xspice code into ngspice. I take xspice code 
  from tclspice (0.2.12). Since tclspice started as a branch of
  ngspice, I have applied the patches developed for it that correcting
  some bugs common to tclspice and ngspice. What follows is the
  extract of tclspice Changelog file that describes the changes:
  
  2003-07-18 Vera Albrecht <albrecht@danalyse.de>

    * Make all the devices in src/spicelib/devices be built
    as archives not shared libraries, and don't install them

  2003-06-22  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
 
     *  Finally got SPICE2 POLY stuff working.  This involved 
    lots of changes in src/xspice/mif and src/xspice/enh.  
    Particular changes were made in:
        --  MIF_INP2A: re-arranged logic to fix parsing problems.
        --  two2three_translate: fixed some stupid pointer problems.
        --  etc.
 
     *  Revamped src/xspice/icm/ and src/xspice/icm/icm_spice2poly
     directories to enable build of POLY codemodel.  
    Makefiles were fixed, and some stuff was added to enable 
    cmpp (from SPICE Opus) to build the codemodel precursors 
    correctly.  (Note that you need to download and install 
    SPICE Opus to rebuild the codemodel stuff.  See  
    src/xspice/icm/README for more details.)
 
     *  Hacked Makefile.am's for much of the directory hierarchy, 
    particularly for src/xspice/icm and 
    src/xspice/icm/icm_spice2poly to build the POLY codemodel 
    correctly.  Note that top level make still doesn't detect 
     changes in the xspice hierarchy; read the NOTES file for 
    a workaround.
 
     *  Added a SPICE netlist incorporating vendor models with 
    SPICE2 POLYs in tests/TransImpedanceAmp/.  Running this 
    model successfully demonstrates that you have built the 
    XSpice POLY codemodel correctly and that life is good 
    . . . .
 
     *  Moved #define TRACE out of src/ngspice.h and made it 
    a compiler option (-DTRACE) invoked in src/Makefile when 
    making spice.o.

  2003-05-02  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
 
     *  Added #define TRACE to main.c for use in debugging.  
    Added lots of printf's in the code which are turned on 
    by defining TRACE. This is used to help figure out what 
    the program is doing at each step . . . . .
   
     *  Added lots of comments all over the source tree.  
    This should help explain what the prog is doing for 
    future hackers.
   
     *  Fixed parser to allow POLY attributes in dependent 
    sources (major changes  in src/frontend/subckt.c, as 
    well as move location of call to ENHtranslate_poly in 
    src/frontend/inp.c)
   
     *  Fixed bug in device init files 
    (src/spicelib/devices/*init.c)
     so that Deviceinfo structures operated with XSPICE.
 
     *  Fixed nasty malloc problem in src/xspice/mif/mifgetmod.c 
    which casued frequent segfaults (when compiled with XSPICE).

  
2002-01-03  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  * acconfig.h: added define needed for Windows and some aesthetic
    rework (from Holger Vogt patch).
  
  * configure.in: added macros to handle windows related 
    issues (Holger patch and me).
  
  * INSTALL: added documentation on ngspice compilation under
    Windows (Holger Vogt patch).

    me).
  
   

2001-12-05  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

  * configure.in: removed (unnecessary) macros to handle GNU getopt
  (I'm an idiot!)

2001-12-04  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

  * configure.in, main.c: Forgot a bit to handle GNU getopt correctly

2001-11-25  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

  * configure.in: New way (cleaner) to handle GNU getopt.

2001-01-21  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

  * bsim3soi_dd/*: BSIM3SOI (DD) support added as level 11. Added tests in 
    tests directory (tests/bsim3soidd/*).

  * ???: Integrated patch form Alan Gillespie <Alan.Gillespie@analog.com>
  to revert the spice raw format to the spice3 original. 

  * configure.in: corrected a bug that broke the on line help system.
  Help system now works again but its text is a little bit outdated.

  * ???: all binaries now have ng prepended, so ngspice can be installed
  with other spice flavours.
  
  
2000-10-18  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  trealloc and txfree.

2000-09-05  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * ???: Paolo and I have integrated patches from Alan Gillespie
  <Alan.Gillespie@analog.com>.

2000-07-28  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * tests/polezero/*.out: Changed the content of these files because
  the bug that caused the incorrect pole-zero results have been
  traced to src/spicelib/analysis/cktpzstr.c.

2000-07-05  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/devices/dev.c: Added first_device() and next_device() to
  abstract manipulations to the devices list.  Now change all the
  code that uses direct access to these functions...

2000-07-03  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/parser/alias.c, src/parser/alias.h: contain frontend alias
  command.  Moved them to src/frontend/com_alias.c and
  src/frontend/com_alias.h.  Updated Makefile.am's as appropreate.

  * src/parser/front.c, src/parser/front.h, src/parser/history.c,
  src/parser/history.h, src/parser/modify.c, src/parser/modify.h,
  src/parser/variable.c, src/parser/variable.h: Empty files.
  Removed.

  * src/include/spconfig.h: Removed spCOMPLEX,
  spSEPARATED_COMPLEX_VECTORS and spCOMPATIBILITY defines.  This
  made including this file from src/include/spmatrix.h unnecessary.
  Moved this file to src/maths/sparse/spconfig.h.

  * src/include/spmatrix.h: Removed include of
  src/include/spconfig.h.
  
  * src/maths/sparse/spalloc.c, src/maths/sparse/spbuild.c,
  src/maths/sparse/spcombin.c, src/maths/sparse/spdefs.h,
  src/maths/sparse/spfactor.c, src/maths/sparse/spoutput.c,
  src/maths/sparse/spsmp.c, src/maths/sparse/spsolve.c,
  src/maths/sparse/sputils.c: The other files affected by the
  removal of spCOMPLEX, spSEPARATED_COMPLEX_VECTORS and
  spCOMPATIBILITY defines.  Also: assertions are enabled by
  default.

  * src/include/smpdefs.h, src/maths/sparse/spsmp.c: SMPmatrix is
  now a typedef for void, instead of char.  Updated all function
  declarations to match this.  Also added function prototypes not
  previously mentioned in src/include/smpdefs.h.
  
  * src/include/complex.h: Updates of cast from char * to void *

  * src/analysis/cktsens.c: Matrices cannot be created non-complex.
  Also added a check to detect an error condition on delta_Y =
  spCreate(...).


2000-06-27  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/parser: Refactored commands from the frontend into the
  frontend directory.  Major changes to organization, but not to
  functionality.

2000-06-19  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/analysis/cktask.c: moved to src/devices.
  
  * src/analysis/cktbindn.c: moved, renamed to
  src/devices/cktbindnode.c.
  
  * src/analysis/cktfdev.c: moved, renamed to
  src/devices/cktfinddev.c.

2000-06-18  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * AUTHORS, doc/ngspice.texi: Included an acknowledgements
  section.

2000-06-16  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/frontend/doplot.c: Refactored into the following files:
  src/frontend/com_asciiplot.c src/frontend/com_asciiplot.h
  src/frontend/com_hardcopy.c src/frontend/com_hardcopy.h
  src/frontend/com_plot.c src/frontend/com_plot.h
  src/frontend/com_xgraph.c src/frontend/com_xgraph.h
  src/frontend/plotting/plotit.c src/frontend/plotting/plotit.h

  * src/frontend/Makefile.am src/frontend/plotting/Makefile.am:
  Updated to match the new files.

2000-06-15  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/frontend/graphdb.c, src/frontend/graphdb.c,
  src/frontend/Makefile.am, src/frontend/plotting/graphdb.c,
  src/frontend/plotting/graphdb.c,
  src/frontend/plotting/Makefile.am: Moved plotting specific files
  into plotting directory.

2000-06-05  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * tests/*: Added a little hierarchy to the tests.  Removed
  config.sh in favor of check.sh.  This script does all checking.
  Made names of the tests better reflect the circuit under test.

2000-06-03  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/include/complex.h, src/include/macros.h,
  src/include/memory.h, src/maths/sparse/spdefs.h: Moved definitions
  of complex into complex.h.  There are three different ways to
  declare a complex number in Spice.  We need further work to reduce
  this to only one.

  * src/maths/cmaths/Makefile.am, src/maths/cmaths/.cvsignore,
  src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_ph.c:  Added a new test and updated the
  corresponding support files.

2000-06-02  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/circuit/inp2dot.c: Refactoring introduced a bug in the line
  parsing.  Passing line as an extra parameter to the refactored
  functions fixes the bug.

2000-05-30  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * TODO: Updated.

  * src/maths/cmaths/Makefile.am, src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_mag.c,
  src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_j.c: Added first testcases for complex
  math library.

2000-05-25  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/circuit/inp2dot.c: First refactoring of INP2dot into smaller
  functions.  Still needs work.

  * src/circuit/sperror.c: Reworked, now much simpler.

  * src/include/inpdefs.h, src/include/sperror.h: Removed redundancy
  in the definition of function prototypes.

2000-05-06  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/include/fte*: Broken header files into smaller pieces.  This
  avoids long recompile times as less needs to be rebuilt on changes
  to the header files.  Adjusted all callers to use the new header
  files.  Left a warning message in the header file to indicate its
  obsolescence.  You will see this message when compiling.

  * src/frontend/*: Reorganized part of the frontend commands into
  their own source file.  Moved plotting parts into new plotting
  directory.

  * src/devices/*: Removed all RCS log and rcsid from the devices
  source files.  They only give extra clutter and all the
  information you need is available through CVS.

2000-05-04  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * src/maths/ni/nipzmeth.c: Corrected an overeager deletion.

2000-05-03  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * source tree: removed most of `#ifdef notdef' and made converted
  some function calls from K&R -> ANSI.

2000-05-01  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * Added .cvsignore files to prevent CVS from marking generated
  files as unknown.

  * src/devices/Makefile.am, src/devices/dev.c, src/devices/dev.h,
  src/Makefile.am, src/ngspice.c, src/main.c: Refactored devices
  initialization code into the devices dir.

  * tests/respart.cir, tests/respart.out, tests/respart.sh:
  additional tests for resistor.

1999-12-07  Arno Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

  * source tree: Added MAINTAINERCLEANFILES to Makefile.am to
  eliminate automatically generated cruft from patches.  To create a
  minimal patch between two trees, just do `make maintainer-clean'
  on both trees and run `diff -ruN tree1 tree2'.

1999-10-15  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>
