	  readline with ngspice IS A VIOLATION OF GPL LICENSE, you
	  have been warned. The final decision is up to you. The
	  patch has been applied in the perspective of changing
	  readline library with libedit. Libedit aims to be a
	  replacement of readline and is covered by BSD license.
	  Libedit is available at the URL: libedit.sourceforge.net.
	  
	  Readline code has been extrapolated from a patch available
	  on  http://www.btae.mam.gov.tr/~genc/ngspice/.

		src/spicelib/parser/{inp2dot.c,inp2r.c,inpdomod.c,inpdpar.c,

		Rest of the serious deck reader leaks, plus fixes for the

	2003-07-15 Stefan Jones <stefan.jones@multigig.com>

		* /src/frontend/{com_let.c,com_set.c,evaluate.c,parse.c,
		variable.c}
		src/frontend/parser/complete.c :
		Memory leaks plugged

	2003-04-14 Stefan Jones <stefan.jones@multigig.com>

		* Make all the devices in src/spicelib/devices be built
		as archives not shared libraries, and don't install them

	2003-06-22  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
 
 		*  Finally got SPICE2 POLY stuff working.  This involved 
		lots of changes in src/xspice/mif and src/xspice/enh.  
		Particular changes were made in:
 	   	--  MIF_INP2A: re-arranged logic to fix parsing problems.
 	   	--  two2three_translate: fixed some stupid pointer problems.
 	   	--  etc.
 
 		*  Revamped src/xspice/icm/ and src/xspice/icm/icm_spice2poly
 		directories to enable build of POLY codemodel.  
		Makefiles were fixed, and some stuff was added to enable 
		cmpp (from SPICE Opus) to build the codemodel precursors 
		correctly.  (Note that you need to download and install 
		SPICE Opus to rebuild the codemodel stuff.  See  
		src/xspice/icm/README for more details.)
 
 		*  Hacked Makefile.am's for much of the directory hierarchy, 
		particularly for src/xspice/icm and 
		src/xspice/icm/icm_spice2poly to build the POLY codemodel 
		correctly.  Note that top level make still doesn't detect 
 		changes in the xspice hierarchy; read the NOTES file for 
		a workaround.
 
 		*  Added a SPICE netlist incorporating vendor models with 
		SPICE2 POLYs in tests/TransImpedanceAmp/.  Running this 
		model successfully demonstrates that you have built the 
		XSpice POLY codemodel correctly and that life is good 
		. . . .
 
 		*  Moved #define TRACE out of src/ngspice.h and made it 
		a compiler option (-DTRACE) invoked in src/Makefile when 
		making spice.o.

	2003-05-02  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>
 
 		*  Added #define TRACE to main.c for use in debugging.  
		Added lots of printf's in the code which are turned on 
		by defining TRACE. This is used to help figure out what 
		the program is doing at each step . . . . .
 	
 		*  Added lots of comments all over the source tree.  
		This should help explain what the prog is doing for 
		future hackers.
 	
 		*  Fixed parser to allow POLY attributes in dependent 
		sources (major changes  in src/frontend/subckt.c, as 
		well as move location of call to ENHtranslate_poly in 
		src/frontend/inp.c)
 	
 		*  Fixed bug in device init files 
		(src/spicelib/devices/*init.c)
 		so that Deviceinfo structures operated with XSPICE.
 
 		*  Fixed nasty malloc problem in src/xspice/mif/mifgetmod.c 
		which casued frequent segfaults (when compiled with XSPICE).

	
2002-01-03  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* acconfig.h: added define needed for Windows and some aesthetic
	  rework (from Holger Vogt patch).
	
	* configure.in: added macros to handle windows related 
	  issues (Holger patch and me).
	
	* INSTALL: added documentation on ngspice compilation under
	  Windows (Holger Vogt patch).
	
	* Makefile.am: added Windows compilation code (Holger Vogt patch and
	  me).
	
	 

2001-12-05  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* configure.in: removed (unnecessary) macros to handle GNU getopt
	(I'm an idiot!)

2001-12-04  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* configure.in, main.c: Forgot a bit to handle GNU getopt correctly

2001-11-25  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* configure.in: New way (cleaner) to handle GNU getopt.

2001-01-21  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* bsim3soi_dd/*: BSIM3SOI (DD) support added as level 11. Added tests in 
	  tests directory (tests/bsim3soidd/*).

	* ???: Integrated patch form Alan Gillespie <Alan.Gillespie@analog.com>
	to revert the spice raw format to the spice3 original. 

	* configure.in: corrected a bug that broke the on line help system.
	Help system now works again but its text is a little bit outdated.

	* ???: all binaries now have ng prependend, so ngspice can be installed
	with other spice flavours.
	
	
2000-10-18  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* Makefile.am: Changes for notes dir -> NOTES file conversion.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Make distcheck target work again.

2000-10-17  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* TODO: Little updates.

2000-10-14  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, src/frontend/inpcom.c,
	src/include/complex.h src/include/macros.h, src/include/memory.h
	src/include/ngspice.h, src/maths/cmaths/Makefile.am
	src/maths/cmaths/cmath1.c, src/maths/cmaths/cmath2.c
	src/maths/cmaths/cmath3.c, src/maths/cmaths/cmath4.c
	src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_j.c, src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_mag.c
	src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_ph.c, src/misc/alloc.c src/misc/alloc.h:
	Added support for the Boehm-Weiser conservative garbage collector.

	* NOTES, src/maths/cmaths/cmath.h: Added.

	* notes/Linux.changes, notes/dbx, notes/internal, notes/mac_port
	notes/porting, notes/spice2: Removed or incorporated into
	NOTES.

	* *: replaced malloc, realloc and free calls to use tmalloc,
	trealloc and txfree.

2000-09-05  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* ???: Paolo and I have integrated patches from Alan Gillespie
	<Alan.Gillespie@analog.com>.

2000-07-28  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* tests/polezero/*.out: Changed the content of these files because
	the bug that caused the incorrect pole-zero results have been
	traced to src/spicelib/analysis/cktpzstr.c.

2000-07-05  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/devices/dev.c: Added first_device() and next_device() to
	abstract manipulations to the devices list.  Now change all the
	code that uses direct access to these functions...

2000-07-03  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/parser/alias.c, src/parser/alias.h: contain frontend alias
	command.  Moved them to src/frontend/com_alias.c and
	src/frontend/com_alias.h.  Updated Makefile.am's as appropreate.

	* src/parser/front.c, src/parser/front.h, src/parser/history.c,
	src/parser/history.h, src/parser/modify.c, src/parser/modify.h,
	src/parser/variable.c, src/parser/variable.h: Empty files.
	Removed.

	* src/include/spconfig.h: Removed spCOMPLEX,
	spSEPARATED_COMPLEX_VECTORS and spCOMPATIBILITY defines.  This
	made including this file from src/include/spmatrix.h unnecessary.
	Moved this file to src/maths/sparse/spconfig.h.

	* src/include/spmatrix.h: Removed include of
	src/include/spconfig.h.
	
	* src/maths/sparse/spalloc.c, src/maths/sparse/spbuild.c,
	src/maths/sparse/spcombin.c, src/maths/sparse/spdefs.h,
	src/maths/sparse/spfactor.c, src/maths/sparse/spoutput.c,
	src/maths/sparse/spsmp.c, src/maths/sparse/spsolve.c,
	src/maths/sparse/sputils.c: The other files affected by the
	removal of spCOMPLEX, spSEPARATED_COMPLEX_VECTORS and
	spCOMPATIBILITY defines.  Also: assertions are enabled by
	default.

	* src/include/smpdefs.h, src/maths/sparse/spsmp.c: SMPmatrix is
	now a typedef for void, instead of char.  Updated all function
	declarations to match this.  Also added function prototypes not
	previously mentioned in src/include/smpdefs.h.
	
	* src/include/complex.h: Updates of cast from char * to void *

	* src/analysis/cktsens.c: Matrixes cannot be created non-complex.
	Also added a check to detect an error condition on delta_Y =
	spCreate(...).


2000-06-27  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/parser: Refactored commands from the frontend into the
	frontend directory.  Major changes to organization, but not to
	functionality.

2000-06-19  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/analysis/cktask.c: moved to src/devices.
	
	* src/analysis/cktbindn.c: moved, renamed to
	src/devices/cktbindnode.c.
	
	* src/analysis/cktfdev.c: moved, renamed to
	src/devices/cktfinddev.c.

2000-06-18  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* AUTHORS, doc/ngspice.texi: Included an acknowledgements
	section.

2000-06-16  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/frontend/doplot.c: Refactored into the following files:
	src/frontend/com_asciiplot.c src/frontend/com_asciiplot.h
	src/frontend/com_hardcopy.c src/frontend/com_hardcopy.h
	src/frontend/com_plot.c src/frontend/com_plot.h
	src/frontend/com_xgraph.c src/frontend/com_xgraph.h
	src/frontend/plotting/plotit.c src/frontend/plotting/plotit.h

	* src/frontend/Makefile.am src/frontend/plotting/Makefile.am:
	Updated to match the new files.

2000-06-15  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/frontend/graphdb.c, src/frontend/graphdb.c,
	src/frontend/Makefile.am, src/frontend/plotting/graphdb.c,
	src/frontend/plotting/graphdb.c,
	src/frontend/plotting/Makefile.am: Moved plotting specific files
	into plotting directory.

2000-06-05  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* tests/*: Added a little hierarchy to the tests.  Removed
	config.sh in favor of check.sh.  This script does all checking.
	Made names of the tests better reflect the circuit under test.

2000-06-03  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/include/complex.h, src/include/macros.h,
	src/include/memory.h, src/maths/sparse/spdefs.h: Moved definitions
	of complex into complex.h.  There are three different ways to
	declare a complex number in Spice.  We need further work to reduce
	this to only one.

	* src/maths/cmaths/Makefile.am, src/maths/cmaths/.cvsignore,
	src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_ph.c:  Added a new test and updated the
	corresponding support files.

2000-06-02  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/circuit/inp2dot.c: Refactoring introduced a bug in the line
	parsing.  Passing line as an extra parameter to the refactored
	functions fixes the bug.

2000-05-30  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* TODO: Updated.

	* src/maths/cmaths/Makefile.am, src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_mag.c,
	src/maths/cmaths/test_cx_j.c: Added first testcases for complex
	math library.

2000-05-25  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/circuit/inp2dot.c: First refactoring of INP2dot into smaller
	functions.  Still needs work.

	* src/circuit/sperror.c: Reworked, now much simpler.

	* src/include/inpdefs.h, src/include/sperror.h: Removed redundancy
	in the definition of function prototypes.

2000-05-06  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/include/fte*: Broken header files into smaller pieces.  This
	avoids long recompile times as less needs to be rebuilt on changes
	to the header files.  Adjusted all callers to use the new header
	files.  Left a warning message in the header file to indicate its
	obsolence.  You will see this message when compiling.

	* src/frontend/*: Reorganized part of the frontend commands into
	their own source file.  Moved plotting parts into new plotting
	directory.

	* src/devices/*: Removed all RCS log and rcsid from the devices
	source files.  They only give extra clutter and all the
	information you need is available through CVS.

2000-05-04  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* src/maths/ni/nipzmeth.c: Corrected an overeager deletion.

2000-05-03  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* source tree: removed most of `#ifdef notdef' and made converted
	some function calls from K&R -> ANSI.

2000-05-01  Arno W. Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* Added .cvsignore files to prevent CVS from marking generated
	files as unknown.

	* src/devices/Makefile.am, src/devices/dev.c, src/devices/dev.h,
	src/Makefile.am, src/ngspice.c, src/main.c: Refactored devices
	initialization code into the devices dir.

	* tests/respart.cir, tests/respart.out, tests/respart.sh:
	additional tests for resistor.

1999-12-07  Arno Peters  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* source tree: Added MAINTAINERCLEANFILES to Makefile.am to
	eliminate automatically generated cruft from patches.  To create a
	minimal patch between two trees, just do `make maintainer-clean'
	on both trees and run `diff -ruN tree1 tree2'.

1999-10-15  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* source tree: entirely modified by Arno Peters (after discussion
	on the mailing list)

	                        src/lib/fte/x11disp.c )
	
	
Spaghetti:
----------
	(25/07/99)

	- first attempt at autoconf/automake support

	- based on spice3f5-chili, hardly anything touched on it.
