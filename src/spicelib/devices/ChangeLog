	* devlist.c, test-devlist: Additional checks revealed a bug,
	first_device() and next_device() should now do what they are
	supposed to do.

	* devlist.c, devlist.h: Another step towards
	dynamically loadable devices.  The first_device() and
	next_device() functions abstract away the actual
	implementation of the devices list.  Currently it is a fixed
	length array, when we start supporting dynamically loaded devices,
	this is no longer true.

	* test_devlist.c: Checks the implementation of first_device()
	and next_device().

	* Makefile.am: Added support for BSIM4

	* *.c : replaced all FABS macros by the 'fabs' function  

2000-01-14	Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	* Added bsim3v1 and bsim3v2 directories. They containthe old bsim3 
	models V3.2 and V3.1. This models are still used in commercial 
	simulators and some components libraries relies upon them.
