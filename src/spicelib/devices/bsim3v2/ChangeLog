	* bsim3v2def.h : Added BSIM3V2owner to the BSIM3V2instance structure 
	for compatibility with Cider. This spice uses a modificed version of 
	devices, as desscribed in the CIDer package, for a "parallel" 
	processing support.
 	
	* b3v2{acld,cvtest,getic,ld,pzld,set,temp,trunc}.c:
	  added the check if the current instance is a task of this
	  processor. This is part of the "parallel" support of Cider.

	* *.c : replaced all FABS macros by the 'fabs' function 

	* *.c : had to rename structure bsim3SizeDependParam into
	 BSIM3V2SizeDependParam for consistency
