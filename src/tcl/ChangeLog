25/07/2002:
	* Modified configure/Makefiles so use --enable-tcl to make module
	* Added option --enable-cluster to configure for cluster version
	* Swig no longer needed to compile
23/07/2002:
	* Added display device Tk plot
	* Added function bltplot
17/04/2002:
	* Merged a version of cluster spice.
26/03/2002:
	* New TCL function lastVector.
19/02/2002:
	* User nodes and codemodels now work in DCtrans analysis, 
	calculated results are now correct.
	* Fixed bug where the first timestep always seems to fail to converge
	after a resume or a step, thus cutting delta.
30/01/2002:
	* Precompiled Opus/XSpice models are now supported with 
	--enable-xspice flag, load them using codemodel "opus spice module"
22/01/2002:
	* Fixed parameters being ignored when mosfet model is not found
16/01/2002:
	* Fixed crash when a mosfet model is not found
In the mists of time:
	* Changed spicelib/parser/inpgtok.c to allow / * ^ in node names (/ needed for ext2spice)
	* Modifed files in 
	 spicelib/analysis/(acan.c, dctran.c, dctrcurv.c, noisean.c), frontend/outitf.c,
	 frontend/runcoms.c, frontend/runcoms2.c
	 so rawfiles continue to be written to after a pause then a resume
	* Small modification to main.c to make the struct nutmeginfo global, so tclspice can use it. 
	* Added ifdefed code to frontend/outitf.c which links output to tclspice.
	* Modified main.c and frontend/inp.c so .save lines are always processed
	* ifdefed code in misc/alloc.c so the functions use Tcl_Mutex to stop memory allocation conflicts.
	* Fixed crash in com_resume() when run without circuit loaded
