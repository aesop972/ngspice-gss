	* inpfindl.c: Modified the file for BSIM4 and future extensions to
                      BSIM5 and BSIM6. I have merged the inpfindl.c coming 
		      with the BSIM4 distribution.
	* inp2r.c:    Added acval=val to initialize the acval parameter to
	              a significative value. Hope does not brak anything. 
		      
		      
	* inp2m.c:    Added BSIM4 support.
	
	* inpdomod.c: Added support for BSIM4 device model.

    * ptfuncs.c: I have applied a couple of patches by GLAO Dezay. He noted
                 that PTln, PTlog and PTsqrt returned non consistent values
		 if the argument was out of domain. If arg <0 they returned 
		 f(-arg). The patch is masked by #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_CODE. 
		 You have to remove these lines or #define it to compile
		 Dezai's patched code.

    *  inp2dot.c: Applied Glao Dezai patch, adding which = -1 in the .sens code.
 
2000-01-17 Paolo Nenzi  <p.nenzi@ieee.org>
	*  inp2m.c, inpdomod.c: Inserted code to dupport BSIM3V1 model as 
	   level 49.
	
2000-01-16 Paolo Nenzi  <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

	*  inp2r.c: Modified resistor code. Added ac value (ala HSPICE), from
	   Serban Popescu contributed sources.

2000-01-15  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

        *   inp2m.c, inpdomod.c : Inserted code to support BSIM3V2 model as
            level 50. 

1999-12-20  Paolo Nenzi <p.nenzi@ieee.org>

        *   inpgtok.c, inpptree.c: Bug Fix
            Bug: Scale factors (eg. m, k, meg, etc.) for constants in arbitrary
            source (b devices) are not recognized.
            Fix: Changes to inpgtok.c and inpptree.c, as supplied by Berkeley.
            NOTE:  These changes were orignally supplied to me as a patch to 3e2 
            by Beorn Johnson who was maintaining Spice a while back.  They were 
            supposed to have been incorporated in Spice 3f2 at that time, but are 
            missing from the 3f5 version that I recently got from Berkeley.  I
            don't know if they were removed in ignorance or because of a conflict
            with some other requirement, but they appear to work in 3f5.  ALSO,
            the fix for 3e2 had many more changes, all of which remain in 3f5, so
            don't try these alone on 3e2.
 
1999-09-07  Arno  <A.W.Peters@ieee.org>

	* inpsymt.c: removed unused function prototype for local_remove().

	* sperror.c: removed unused variable `notempty'

1999-09-05  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* inpptree.c (PTdifferentiate): removed superfluous argument
	to 2 occurences of function mkf

	* *.c: put all function prototypes in inp.h 

1999-08-28  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* Removed all #includes of misc.h and util.h (now in spice.h)

1999-08-24  Paolo Nenzi <pnenzi@ieee.ing.uniroma1.it>

	* inpdomod.c: added level check for ps model, jfet level 2

	* inp2j.c: added code for ps model, jfet level 2
1999-08-08  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* inp2dot.c (INP2dot):changed HAS_SENSE2 in WANT_SENSE2 

1999-08-03  Emmanuel Rouat  <emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr>

	* ptfuncs.c: changed HAS_ATRIGH to HAVE_ACOSH,HAVE_ASINH and
	HAVE_ATANH provided in config.h
