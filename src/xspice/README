Spice Opus / XSpice code model support.
--------------------------------------

Use configure flag --enable-xspice to compile the support in,
when you run the ./configure script.
This creates a new command, "codemodel", which you can 
use to load a codemodel. 

Some codemodels are included in the xspice/lib directory 
with some examples in xspice/examples, compiled for linux glibc.

Make sure the the library dir, xspice/lib, is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
enviromental variable, otherwise the libs will not be found! 

To create codemodels go to http://www.fe.uni-lj.si/spice/welcome.html
and download their trial version of spice opus for the codemodel toolkit!

TODO:
	Intergrate the ipc stuff from XSpice.
	Create ng-spice capacity to create codemodels (a perl script)
	Ngspice crashes when you try to plot a digital node
