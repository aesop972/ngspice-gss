  1.  INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL INFORMATION



 1.1 What is ngspice ?

  Ngspice is the name of a project and of a program in the project.
  The idea behind the project is to improve the capabilities of the
  Spice 3f5 circuit simulator. Spice is the most famous circuit 
  simulator, developed at the University of California at Berkeley 
  (UCB), by "a cast of thousand". The NG prefix has a lot of meanings: 
  Next Generation, New Good, etc. Choose or invent the one you prefer. 
  The heart of the project is the ngspice program, a circuit simulator 
  derived from spice3f5.


 1.2 Why resurrecting Berkeley's Spice?
  
  Berkeley's Spice can be considered the father of most circuit
  simulators available today. It is an old but still good piece of
  software, it may not be the fastest or the most reliable but it's
  free, it's available in source code and most of the electrical
  simulators inherited it's syntax. On the more technical side, spice3
  uses good numerical algorithms (most commercial implementations have
  only strengthened them), implements most of the models for MOSFET
  submicron designs and has a powerful set of analyses. On the more
  "social" side, spice3 it's well introduced in the academic
  environment.

 
 1.3 What is the project's goal?

  The project goal evolved during project development, at first the
  final goal was to develop a reliable, fast and friendly circuit 
  simulator for mixed signal/mixed level simulation. During 
  development it become apparent that to reach the goal a complete
  rewrite of spice was needed. Since it was almost absurd to rewrite
  Spice and since a new simulator was already under development:
  ACS (Al's Circuit Simulator), now GNUCap (GNU Circuit Analyis
  package), the goal of nspice became less utopical: merge
  spice, xspice and cider into a mixed-signal/mixed-level simulator
  that can be used as a reliable engine. 


1.4 What you are going to do?  

  We are going to develop a mixed-signal/mixed-level circuit simulation
  program integrating three different spice based simulators:
  Spice, Xspice and Cider.
  
  Xspice is a mixed-signal circuit simulator developed by GTRI (Georgia 
  Tech Research Institute) at Georgia Institute of Technology. Xspice
  was originally developed as an extension over Spice3c1. Xspice
  introduces code modeling and a digital simulator into ngspice.
  The "home site" of Xspice is: 
  
           http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~mrichard/Xspice/
  
  Cider is a mixed-level circuit and device simulator based on Spice3f5
  that couples a device simulator (DSIM) to Spice. More information can
  be found at:
  
        http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/Software/cider.html 
  
  The merging process is done in parallel with bug fixing and improvement
  of the three simulators. The improvements are concentrated into 6
  directives:
  
  
  + Compact models:  the improvements in compact models will address
    mainly the implementation of additional effects not available
    in the original code. Device specific improvements are documented
    on ngspice's documentation and in the DEVICE file in project's
    tarball.
    Improvements that affects all devices already implemented are:
    "dtemp" option to set instance's temperature relative to the circuit 
    one, "m" parallel multiplier to simulate an arbitrary number of
    instances of the same kind connected in parallel.
    
    Planned improvements are the development of a dynamic loading
    mechanism for compact models, to avoid loading in memory devices
    that are not needed, and SOAR (Safe Operating ARea) checks to 
    identify situations in which devices are used out of their
    safety areas.  
  
  
  + Simulator's analyses: this is a low priority area. Planned improvements
    include the implementation of parametric analyses, to analyse the
    behavior of the circuit as a parameter changes. Parameter sweep,
    Monte Carlo and Worst Case fall in this category. Network analysis
    (double bipole parameters extraction) is another planned improvement.       
    
  
  + Numerical analysis code: the improvements within the numerical code
    must be done with extreme care. Planned improvements are, the 
    replacement of the Sparse library with the latest code Kenneth Kundert
    has released, available at:

               http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparse
   
   Other planned improvements, but with very low priority, includes the
   use SuperLU library as possible Sparse library replacement (the 
   library is available at http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU) and the
   introduction of continuation metohds to aid DC convergence. 
  
  
  + Spice language: The language used to input the circuit to the simulator
    has been extended and now allows the user to input parametric values
    for components (the numparam library). This is an experimental feature 
    that will be improved in the future. Planned improvements includes the
    support for loading more than one circuit, netlist manipulation via
    command line (adding and removing instances) and the implementation
    of a command history using the libedit library, available at:
     
                 http://sourceforge.net/projects/libedit
    
  
  + Frontend: The design of a new spice frontend has not been successful
    and now is orphaned, since the is no interests and many free and
    commercial frontends are available. There is no planned improvement
    here.
    
  
  + Documentation: Commercial simulators have very good manuals with
    tutorials, models equations explained, example of use, suggestions,
    etc. Spice came with little documentation. The Spice3f manual, 
    available on the Internet will be constantly improved during
    ngspice development and integrated with the documentation 
    accompanying Xspice and Cider. This is a very time consuming task
    and probably the documentation will always be left slightly 
    behind.
   


  1.5 Legal issues

  Ngspice merges three different simulators: spice and cider are covered
  with the "old" BSD license, Xspice by its own license. The ngspice 
  license will be then the BSD license. 
  
  Since the "old" BSD license is not compatible with the GPL library
  it is not possible to link the ngspice with GPL'ed code, as is
  written in:
  
             http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html
   
  The group developing ngspice has written to Berkeley's copyright holders
  asking to change the license to the new BSD, which has the 
  incompatibility removed, but without success. Ngspice will probably
  never be relased under the GPL license.
