This file contains a list of known but not yet fixed bugs in ngspice.
===========================================================================

How to submit a bug report:

There are three ways to report a bug you have discovered in ngspice:

    * Bug tracker: This is the preferred method of reporting a bug. 
      Using the tracker on Sourceforge.ner site will make your report 
      open by everyone and the chances of finding a fix will increase.
      
    * ngspice-bugs list: If you have used ngspice, you probably noticed 
      that the banner that appears when ngspice starts says that you can 
      send bug reports to the ngspice-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net address. 
      This is the address of a mailing list dedicated to receive bug reports.
    
    * ngspice-devel list: If you are a member of this list, you can write 
      directly to the developers' list. Do not subscribe to the list only 
      for sending bug reports.

Before sending a bug report please note: all information you send to the bug 
tracking system or on the mailing lists is public. If you need to send 
sensitive information, send them to a developer directly but still write non
sensitive data on the bug tracking system to keep track of bug history.

OPEN BUGS:

* output redirection:

   ngspice 1 -> print v(1) > data.txt

  This syntax does not work anymore (it worked in rework-14). If you 
  want to use output redirection you have to remove spaces around ">":

   ngspice 1 -> print v(1)>data.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* return value:

  When ngspice is called in batch mode it returns 1 even if the simulations
  are run. The problem arise when there is a .control section but no
  .print, .plot or .fourier lines. Ngspice outputs:
  
    Note: No ".plot", ".print", or ".fourier" lines; no simulations run 
  
  and exits returning 1.
  
  Workaround: add -r <dummyfile> to the command line to avoid this.
