List of Things To Do
====================


Standards conformance
---------------------

Add proper copyright headers to every source, header, documentation
and other files

Fix all compiler warnings

Remove smktemp() in favor of tmpfile() or other ANSI C equivalent;
Note: different symantics!

Write a asprintf() replacement for systems that don't have it
available.


Usability issues
------------------

Plug all memory leaks (use debauch from
http://quorum.tamu.edu/jon/gnu/ to find them)

Either get help program functioning again; OR interface to webbrowser,
info reader and get rid of all help-related code.  Option 2 is the
most appealing.


Refactorings
------------

Make devices dynamically loadable (perhaps use framework from glib)

Separate out analysis code in much the same way as the devices code

Separate ngspice and nutmeg; i.e., no more SIMULATOR define

Integrate bsim3, bsim3v1, bsim3v2 to use a single codebase instead of
three only slighty differing implementations

Separate frontend commands from supporting code.  Command files
start with com_*. [PARTIAL]

Move src/devices/disto into src/maths/partialderiv.  Partial
derivatives are math functions and should be classified under that
directory.

Refactor src/circuit/inp2dot.c so that the parser calls subroutines
for each possible dotcard. [PARTIAL]


Testability
===========

Add tests for all functions in the complex library in
src/maths/cmaths.

Add tests for all functions in the sparse matrix library in
src/maths/sparse.

Add tests for all functions in the polynomial library in
src/maths/poly.
