List of Things To Do
====================


Standards conformance
---------------------

Add proper copyright headers to every source, header, documentation
and other files.

Fix all compiler warnings.

Remove smktemp() in favor of tmpfile() or other ANSI C equivalent;
Note: different symantics!

Write a asprintf() replacement for systems that don't have it
available.

Prefix all functions in the spice library with spice_*.


Usability issues
------------------

Plug all memory leaks; use debauch (http://quorum.tamu.edu/jon/gnu/)
or another memory checker to find them.

Either get help program functioning again; OR interface to webbrowser,
info reader and get rid of all help-related code.  Option 2 is the
most appealing.


Refactorings
------------

Netlist parsing.  The circuit directory currrently has definitions for
parsing one model line per device.  Get this generalized into a
structure that codifies the changes between the devices.  At a later
stage, distribute the structure into the devices directories.  The
generic parser remains in the spice library.

Separate ngspice and nutmeg; i.e., no more SIMULATOR define.  ngspice
should probably only contain the batch processor.  nutmeg would have
the complete frontend.

Integrate bsim3, bsim3v1, bsim3v2 to use a single codebase instead of
three only slighty differing implementations.  This also cuts down
compilation time.

All frontend commands can now be found in the frontend directory.
Move frontend helper functions into frontend directory as well.
Not all files that define commands, start with com_*; fix that.

Make devices dynamically loadable.  Perhaps use framework from glib
(http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/glib/index.html).


Testability
-----------

Add tests for all functions in the complex library in
src/maths/cmaths.

Add tests for all functions in the sparse matrix library in
src/maths/sparse.

Add tests for all functions in the polynomial library in
src/maths/poly.

Add tests for all functions in the derivative library in
src/maths/deriv.

Add more circuit tests into the tests directory.


Documentation
-------------

Update ARCHITECTURE to contain a high level overview of spice.

Convert ngspice.texi further to texinfo format. [PARTIAL]

Distribute devices documentation into the devices tree.  This makes it
easier for developers to update documentation in concert with code.

Update manual pages for spice and nutmeg.  Perhaps generate them with
c2man or some other documentation generation utility.
