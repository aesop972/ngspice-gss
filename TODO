List of Things To Do
====================


Standards conformance
---------------------

Add proper copyright headers to every source, header, documentation
and other files

Fix all compiler warnings

Remove smktemp() in favor of tmpfile(); Note: different symantics!



Usability issues
------------------

Plug all memory leaks (use debauch from
http://quorum.tamu.edu/jon/gnu/ to find them)

Either get help program functioning again; OR interface to webbrowser,
info reader and get rid of all help-related code.  Option 2 is the
most appealing.


Refactorings
------------

Make devices dynamically loadable (perhaps use framework from glib)

Separate out analysis code in much the same way as the devices code

Separate ngspice and nutmeg; i.e., no more SIMULATOR define

Integrate bsim3, bsim3v1, bsim3v2 to use a single codebase instead of
three only slighty differing implementations
