readline-patch: This patch is not included in the source since the readline 
                library is released under the GPL (GNU Public License) and 
                ngspice is released under the old BSD license, which is 
                incompatible with GPL. Patching ngspice with this cose is a 
                violation of GPL. This code is included here since has been
                requested by many spice user. The use of this code is 
                discouraged since GPL is probably the last and only line of
                defense of open source software.

                If you want to know more about the license issue, look at 
                the GNU site: htt://www.gnu.org
